function [Mi2ip1,Mi2im1,theta_p] = dI_mirror_dthetadB(theta_lims,B)
% DI_MIRROR_DTHETADB - Magnetic mirroring multi-stream transfer
% DI_MIRROR_DTHETADB calculates the pitch-angle-stream-to-
% pitchangle-stream transfer caused by the magnetic mirror-force. 
% The transfer between pitch-angle-streams from one altitue to
% another, with different magnetic field-strengths are calculated
% using B_2/B_1 = sin(theta_2)^2/sin(theta_1)^2 and assuming that
% the pitch-angle distribution is isotropic inside every
% pitch-angle-stream at every step
%
% Calling:
%   [Mi2ip1,Mi2im1,theta_p] = dI_mirror_dthetadB(theta_lims,B)
% Input:
%   theta_lims - pitch-angle-limits for the streams used (radians),
%                double array [1 x (n_streams+1)], typically in the
%                range [0,pi]
%   B          - magnetic-field (T), either double array [n_z x 1] 
%                or [n_z x 3], if the magnetic field is given
%                instead of the magnetic field-strength the
%                function will adapt.
% Output:
%   Mi2ip1  - cell-array [1 x n_mu] with transfer-factor-vectors
%             [n_z x 1] from pitch-angle-stream(s) i_mu to i_mu+1
%   Mi2im1  - cell-array [1 x n_mu] with transfer-factor-vectors
%             [n_z x 1] from pitch-angle-stream(s) i_mu to i_mu-1
%   theta_p - pitch-angle-limit-chage-array [n_z x (n_mu+1)]
%             containing the pitch-angle-limit at altitude i_z
%             mirrored to altitude i_z+1
